# WiFi based localization algorithm

Use Case:
Determining the position of the user (latitude, longitude, floor, building) using the database based on WLAN fingerprint (also know as WiFi Fingerprinting).

The UJIIndoorLoc database covers three buildings of Universitat Jaume I with 4 or more floors and almost 110.000m2. It can be used for classification, e.g. actual building and floor identification, or regression, e.g. actual longitude and latitude estimation. It was created in 2013 by means of more than 20 different users and 25 Android devices.
